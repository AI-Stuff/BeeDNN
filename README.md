# test_DNN

Test_DNN is a small set of Octave/Matlab functions to play/learn with DNN algorithms.

The goal is to have a minimal, clear and concise samples and API so everybody can contribute and play with DNN.
No dependencies needed.

Implemented: 
- dense layer
- mini batch learn
- momentum
- many activation functions

Just run test_* to test.

Then, for real applications, TensorFlow, Caffe or tiny-dnn are good choices.
