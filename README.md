# test_DNN

Test_DNN is a small set of functions to play/learn with DNN algorithms.

The goal is to have a minimal, clear and concise samples and API so everybody can contribute and play with DNN.
No dependencies needed, every algorithm rewritten. 

Implemented:
- dense layer
- mini batch learn
- momentum
- several activation functions
- early abort


In mfiles/ folder, the Octave/Matlab functions for prototyping (Just run test_* to test)

in cpp/ folder, a C++ implementation, with console tests and in Qt.


Later, for real applications, TensorFlow, Caffe or tiny-dnn are good choices.
