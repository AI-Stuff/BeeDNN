# test_DNN

Test_DNN is a small set of functions to play/learn with DNN algorithms.

The goal is to have a minimal, clear and concise samples and API so everybody can contribute and play with DNN.
No dependencies needed, every algorithm rewritten. 

Implemented:
- dense layer
- mini batch learn
- momentum
- several activation functions
- early abort

in src/ folder, a C++ implementation, with console test and in Qt.

Later, for industrial applications, TensorFlow, Caffe or tiny-dnn are good choices.
