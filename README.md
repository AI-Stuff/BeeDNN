# test_DNN

Test_DNN is a small set of Octave/Matlab functions to play/learn with DNN algorithms.

The goal is to have clear and concise samples and API so everybody can contribute and play with DNN.
No dependencies needed.

Just run test_* to test.


Then, for real applications, TensorFlow, Caffe or tiny-dnn are good choices.
